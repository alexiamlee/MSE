# MSE 

* [ ] MSE 542 is the first class in a sequence leading to the UW Graduate Certificate in Data Science for Materials Engineering.
* [ ] My goal is to develop my Python competencies during my graduate studies in Materials Science and Engineering, in support of my ambition to become a dentist-scientist. I hope to leverage Python in biomaterials engineering research and development for oral healthcare.
